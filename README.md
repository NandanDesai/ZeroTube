# ZeroTube
This is a project where I will be trying collaborative software development. The plan is to create a desktop YouTube client that doesn't use YouTube API (i.e., it should parse the YouTube website to get the contents).
The user can either stream or instantly download the videos.
I am still not sure if this is going to work but here is the plan:

*We will use Jsoup to parse the HTML page and get elements from it.

*We will use VLCJ to embed a video player into our application.

*A similar app already exists on Android platform which is extremely awesome.

This project should be a clear object-oriented approach.
